For the next two sections, the concepts are simply too abstract, 
and adding to the current code is just impossible for any kind of 
theoretical approach. As such, I will be skipping ChatGPT usage for 
the Semantic Analysis and Code Generation sections of the compiler 
project. This was quite interesting, and to be honest, in the first
two sections, I was quite surprised at the detail and accuracy that 
ChatGPT was able to bring. However, it still clearly missed quite a 
bit, and couldn't understand most of the more specific rules 
provided.
