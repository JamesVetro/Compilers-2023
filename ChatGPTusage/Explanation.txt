For this lab, on top of designing a compiler, I also wanted to do some exploration into AI tools for coding.
The one I decided to use for this lab was ChatGPT, an OpenAI project.

For the lab's use, I'm posting all logs of discussions between myself and the ChatGPT tool, as well as any code fragments
it provides. 

Obviously, all final code is developed independently, with just basics being asked of ChatGPT.
ChatGPT is not designed to be able to actually complete this project, but it's interesting to see what kind of work it
can do, given even the most basic questions.
